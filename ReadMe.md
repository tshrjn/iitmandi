## AIM:

This project aims to provide a central repository for exams, homework assignments, solutions, and more to facilitate learning for exams. The project relies on the assistance of students. Everyone can help by uploading his/her slides, exercises, lectures  and sending in a pull request.

### Description:

All files offered here - which come from a chair - can also be obtained from their lecture websites and are available on the internet for all students from the respective university. All files are still protected with the built-in mechanisms (if they were) and have not been altered in any way (such as password-removal for PDF files). If provided transcripts or other content uploaded by students present in the archive, are copyright protected and may not be present here, the file will be immediately removed upon request. If you find such a file, please tell us by creating an issue, so the files can be removed.

## Adding new Courses
- Fork the repo
- Follow the structure and find suitable location of course.
- Add course folder if not present
- Add folder for the semester for which you have the content. (Fall/Spring i.e Aug-Nov or Feb-May)
- Add the course content there.
- add, commit and push your updated repo.
- Send a pull request to add to the main repo


## Migration:

Due to repository size restriction and hence, inability to share content this project is being shifted to https://unistuf.org
